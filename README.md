# Book Management API

## Overview

This API provides a set of endpoints for managing book data, including books, authors, and publications. It's built using Node.js, Express, and a sample in-memory database.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

Node.js: Download and install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/.
npm (Node Package Manager): Typically included with Node.js.
nodemon (optional, for automatic reloading): Install globally using npm install -g nodemon.

**Clone the repository:**

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-management-api.git
Use code with caution. Learn more

**Install dependencies:**

Bash
cd book-management-api
npm install
Use code with caution. Learn more

Start the server:

Using nodemon: npx nodemon index.js
Without nodemon: node index.js

## Endpoints

## Further Development

Database: Replace the in-memory database with a persistent database solution (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).

Error handling: Improve error handling and provide informative responses to clients.
Additional features: Add features for creating, updating, and deleting books, authors, and publications.
